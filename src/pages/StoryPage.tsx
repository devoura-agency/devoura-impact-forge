                  It was a rainy Tuesday evening when everything changed. I was scrolling through social media, 
                  feeling disconnected from the world, when I stumbled upon a small NGO's page. Their mission was beautiful, 
                  their work was transformative, but their website... it broke my heart.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  Here was an organization feeding hundreds of children daily, educating girls in remote villages, 
                  and literally saving lives - yet their digital presence couldn't convey even a fraction of their impact. 
                  That night, I couldn't sleep. I kept thinking about all the potential donors, volunteers, and supporters 
                  who would never discover this incredible organization simply because they couldn't tell their story online.

                  I started researching and what I found shattered me. Thousands of NGOs across the world were struggling 
                  with the same problem. Organizations doing God's work, fighting poverty, saving the environment, 
                  empowering women - all of them struggling to reach the people who cared about their cause.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  The statistics were heartbreaking: 70% of NGOs lose potential donors due to poor online presence. 
                  Millions of rupees in potential funding, thousands of volunteers, countless lives that could be touched - 
                  all lost because these heroes of humanity couldn't tell their stories effectively online.

                  That's when Devoura was born - not as a business, but as a mission. We realized that every NGO 
                  deserves a digital presence as powerful as their purpose. Every organization changing lives deserves 
                  a website that can touch hearts, inspire action, and connect them with people who share their vision.

                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  We don't just build websites; we create digital bridges that connect compassionate hearts with meaningful causes. 
                  Every line of code we write, every design we craft, every feature we implement is driven by one question: 
                  "Will this help an NGO reach more people and amplify their impact?"
